doc(author, 'Generated by LLM').
doc(overview, 'A bread company with production, logistics, retail, and customer demand.').
doc(description, 'Actors communicate via messages. Production and customer arrivals are probabilistic chance nodes. Pie/line charts should visualize message volume by sender.').

doc(role_bakers, 'Bakers operate machines, knead dough, and manage oven loads.').
doc(role_truck, 'Truck loads bagged bread and delivers to the storefront.').
doc(role_storefront, 'Storefront receives bread, stocks racks, sells to customers, and manages aging inventory.').
